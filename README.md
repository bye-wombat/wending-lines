# Wending Lines

This is a living archive, unfolding slowly.

It's an invitation. Not just to make contact, but to explore what crosses between worlds: inner and outer, written and unwritten, present and still emerging.

You are welcome to these lines, follow where they lead, and discover what takes shape along the way.
