# Wending Lines

This is a living archive, unfolding slowly.

A quiet invitation — not just to make contact,  
but to explore the threads that cross between worlds:  
inner and outer, written and unwritten, present and still emerging.

You are welcome to trace these lines,  
to follow where they lead,  
and to discover what takes shape along the way.
